# Dream Server Composability Execution Board

Date: 2026-03-02  
Scope: Turn Dream Server into a broadly installable, highly composable OSS platform.

## North Star

By Day 90, external contributors can:

1. Install on supported platforms from a clear support matrix.
2. Add a new backend service via a stable extension manifest.
3. Add dashboard cards/routes without editing core files.
4. Pass CI matrix checks before merge.

Status: `DONE`  
Owner: Core  
Effort: 2-3 days  
Files:

Progress notes:
- `install.sh` converted to entrypoint wrapper.
- `install-core.sh` created as current Linux implementation.
- `installers/common.sh` + `installers/dispatch.sh` added.
- Added capability profile contract (`config/capability-profile.schema.json`) and generator (`scripts/build-capability-profile.sh`), now consumed by `install-core.sh` for tier/backend/compose decisions with fallback behavior.

Status: `DONE`  
Owner: Core  
Effort: 1-2 days

Acceptance:
- No ambiguous “supported” language when unsupported paths are partial.
- Entry scripts route users to correct installer path.
Progress notes:
- `installers/macos.sh` and `installers/windows.ps1` stubs added.
- `install.sh` dispatch now routes to platform targets (or clear unsupported messaging).
- `installers/windows.ps1` now performs prerequisite checks and delegates to WSL installer path.
- `installers/macos.sh` now runs capability-aware preflight/doctor checks and writes a machine-readable report.
- Added hardware class mapping (`config/hardware-classes.json`, `scripts/classify-hardware.sh`) and capability-profile hardware class fields for explicit GPU-class defaults.
- `scripts/dream-doctor.sh` now emits prioritized autofix hints from preflight/runtime findings.
