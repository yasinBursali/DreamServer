# Dashboard API Development

This guide covers how to iterate on `extensions/services/dashboard-api/` (the FastAPI backend that powers the Dashboard UI) without losing your sanity.

## TL;DR

- Editing `.py` files under `extensions/services/dashboard-api/` on the host **does not** reload the running `dream-dashboard-api` container. The image bakes a copy into `/app/` at build time.
- Run uvicorn natively on the host with `--reload` for fast iteration. The rest of the stack already supports this via `host.docker.internal`.
- Only rebuild the image (or `docker cp` as a stop-gap) when you actually need to ship the change.

## The Trap

The Dockerfile (`extensions/services/dashboard-api/Dockerfile`) does this at build time:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
COPY main.py config.py models.py security.py gpu.py helpers.py agent_monitor.py user_extensions.py ./
COPY routers/ routers/
...
CMD uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${DASHBOARD_API_PORT}
```

Two consequences:

1. The Python source lives at `/app/` inside the image. uvicorn is launched from that `WORKDIR` and imports `main:app` from `/app/main.py`. There is no live link back to the host filesystem.
2. The compose service mounts the host repo at `/dream-server` (read-only) — see `docker-compose.base.yml`:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./scripts:/dream-server/scripts:ro
     - ./config:/dream-server/config:ro
     - ./extensions:/dream-server/extensions:ro
     - ./.env:/dream-server/.env:ro
     ...
   ```

   That bind-mount exists so the API can **read manifests, scripts, and config** at runtime. It is not on Python's import path. Editing `dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api/routers/setup.py` on the host updates `/dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api/routers/setup.py` inside the container — a path nothing imports from. The running uvicorn keeps serving the baked `/app/routers/setup.py`.

If you only test by editing host files and reloading the dashboard, your changes silently no-op. This has bitten contributors before; don't waste an afternoon on it.

## Recommended Workflow: Native uvicorn

Run the API directly on the host with hot-reload. The rest of the compose stack stays running in Docker; the dashboard container reaches your host process via `host.docker.internal`, which is already wired up in `docker-compose.base.yml` (`extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]`).

### One-time setup

```bash
cd dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Each session

Stop the container so the host port is free (run from the install root, where `docker-compose.base.yml` lives):

```bash
cd /path/to/dream-server && docker compose stop dashboard-api
```

Then run uvicorn natively. Set `DREAM_INSTALL_DIR` to the path of your installed Dream Server repo (the same path the container would see as `/dream-server`):

```bash
cd dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api
DREAM_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/dream-server \
DREAM_DATA_DIR=/path/to/dream-server/data \
DREAM_AGENT_PORT=7710 \
DASHBOARD_API_KEY="$(grep ^DASHBOARD_API_KEY /path/to/dream-server/.env | cut -d= -f2-)" \
DREAM_AGENT_KEY="$(grep ^DREAM_AGENT_KEY /path/to/dream-server/.env | cut -d= -f2-)" \
  uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3002 --reload
```

uvicorn's `--reload` uses `watchfiles` and picks up edits to any `.py` file under the working directory.

Other compose services that talk to the dashboard-api (notably the dashboard frontend) reach it on `http://127.0.0.1:3002` from the host or via `host.docker.internal:3002` from another container. No compose changes needed.

Mirror any other env vars your code path reads (`OLLAMA_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`, `KOKORO_URL`, etc.) from the values in `.env`. A small wrapper script that exports the relevant subset is a reasonable thing to keep locally. Note that `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` and `DREAM_AGENT_KEY` are independent secrets (since PR #979 they are no longer aliased) — if you only export one, calls in the direction that needs the other will return 401.

## Stop-gap: `docker cp`

If running native uvicorn isn't an option (you only have Docker, you're debugging something that depends on the container's exact env, etc.), copy the file straight into `/app/` and restart the service:

```bash
cd dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api
docker cp routers/setup.py dream-dashboard-api:/app/routers/setup.py
docker compose restart dashboard-api
```

This survives until the next image rebuild, after which the baked copy wins again. It is a survivable stop-gap for hot patches; it is not a substitute for committing the change.

## Permanent Change: Rebuild the Image

Anything you want to ship has to make it into the image:

```bash
docker compose build dashboard-api
docker compose up -d dashboard-api
```

This is what running installs pick up the next time they pull or rebuild.

## Why Not Just Bind-Mount the Source? (Option B, rejected)

Mapping `./extensions/services/dashboard-api:/app` would give "live edits in the container" at the cost of:

1. **Writable mount required.** Python writes `__pycache__/` next to source files. A read-only bind-mount makes every import fail; a read-write mount lets the container scribble bytecode back into the contributor's working tree.
2. **Breaks standalone use of the prebuilt image.** Anyone running `docker run light-heart-labs/dashboard-api` (or pulling the image without our compose file) would get an empty `/app/` because the bind-mount isn't there. The image would no longer be self-contained.
3. **Divergent dev and prod images.** Dev would import from the bind-mount; prod from the baked copy. Bugs that depend on file layout, permissions, or pycache state would only show up on one path.

Native uvicorn gets the same iteration speed without any of those drawbacks.

## Why Not a `--reload` Compose Overlay? (Option C, rejected)

The obvious alternative is a `docker-compose.dev.yml` that overrides the dashboard-api command:

```yaml
# rejected
services:
  dashboard-api:
    command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3002 --reload --reload-dir /dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api
```

The trap: `WORKDIR` is still `/app`. uvicorn launches in `/app`, imports `main:app` from `/app/main.py`, and watches `/dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api/` for file changes. The watcher fires correctly, uvicorn reloads — and re-imports the **same baked `/app/` code**. The reload appears to work and the change appears to do nothing.

To actually pick up host edits, the overlay has to also change `WORKDIR` (or wrap the command in `bash -c "cd /dream-server/extensions/services/dashboard-api && uvicorn ..."`) and ensure Python's import path points at the bind-mount. At that point you've effectively re-implemented Option B inside an overlay, with all of its drawbacks plus a confusing dev-only command. Running uvicorn on the host is shorter and clearer.

## Cross-Platform Notes

- **macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel).** Native uvicorn works perfectly. Watchfiles uses FSEvents; reloads are fast and reliable. No osxfs involvement because the source is on the host filesystem to begin with.
- **Linux.** Native uvicorn works perfectly. Watchfiles uses inotify.
- **Windows / WSL2.** Run the WSL2 instance (uvicorn) with the repo on the **WSL2 filesystem** (e.g. `~/DreamServer`). Editing on `/mnt/c/...` (the Windows NTFS mount) makes inotify watches unreliable — file change events drop or arrive late. Keep the working tree inside the WSL2 home directory, edit it via VS Code's WSL remote, and reload triggers behave the same as on Linux.
