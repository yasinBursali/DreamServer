# Langfuse post_install hook — Linux bind-mount uid alignment.
#
# The langfuse stack uses upstream images that run as non-root uids baked
# into the image:
#   - postgres:17.9-alpine          -> runs as uid 70  (postgres)
#   - clickhouse/clickhouse-server  -> runs as uid 101 (clickhouse)
#
# On Linux native Docker, bind mounts preserve host uid/gid, so a data
# directory owned by the install user (e.g. 1000:1000) causes initdb to
# fail with "permission denied" on first start. macOS Docker Desktop
# (osxfs/virtiofs) and WSL2 Docker Desktop (virtiofs) mask this by
# translating uids transparently — no chown needed on those platforms.
#
# Hook contract (see bin/dream-host-agent.py:_handle_install):
#   $1 = INSTALL_DIR (absolute path to dream-server install)
#   $2 = GPU_BACKEND (informational; unused here)
#
# Idempotent by nature: chown is a no-op when ownership already matches.
