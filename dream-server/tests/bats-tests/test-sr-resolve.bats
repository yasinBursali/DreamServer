# BATS tests for sr_resolve in lib/service-registry.sh.
# ============================================================================
# Guards against re-breakage of the `dream-<id>` prefix-strip added in
# PR #406 (container names pasted from `docker ps` should resolve to their
# service IDs), and of the broader alias-resolution contract.
#
# 8-case matrix:
#   1. Exact ID               →  resolves to the same ID
#   2. Known alias            →  resolves to canonical ID
#   3. `dream-<id>` prefix    →  strips prefix, resolves to ID
#   4. `dream-<alias>` prefix →  strips prefix, resolves through alias
#   5. Unknown `dream-*`      →  passes through as-is (not our container)
#   6. Unknown non-dream      →  passes through as-is (best-effort)
#   7. Empty input            →  passes through empty
#   8. Container that happens to start with `dream-` but isn't our
#      convention → passes through as-is (no alias match after strip)
#
# We invoke the registry inside a fresh `bash -c` subshell per test because
# `declare -A` at the top of service-registry.sh creates function-local
# arrays when the file is sourced from within bats' setup() (which is a
# shell function). A subshell sources at top level, populating the globals
# sr_resolve then actually reads.
