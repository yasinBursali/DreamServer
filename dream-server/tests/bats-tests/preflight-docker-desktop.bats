# BATS tests for installers/macos/lib/preflight-fs.sh::test_docker_desktop_sharing
# ============================================================================
# Strategy: stub the `docker` binary in PATH so each test deterministically
# emits the message + exit-code combination that real Docker Desktop produces
# when the install dir is (or is not) on the file-sharing allowlist. Source
# the helper, invoke `test_docker_desktop_sharing`, and assert on
# DOCKER_SHARE_OK / DOCKER_SHARE_ERR.
#
# Issue #505 (Docker-Desktop side): the bind-mount probe in preflight-fs.sh
# is a behavioral check — a regression that, e.g., flipped the grep pattern
# or reversed the OK/ERR semantics would currently slip through unit tests.
