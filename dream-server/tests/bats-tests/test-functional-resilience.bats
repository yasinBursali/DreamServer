# BATS tests for scripts/dream-test-functional.sh set -e resilience.
# ============================================================================
# Guards against re-breakage of PR #428:
#   - Arithmetic expansion (TESTS_FAILED=$((TESTS_FAILED + 1))) must not
#     trip `set -e` on the first increment when the counter is 0.
#   - The summary line and the final exit code must be emitted even when
#     every underlying functional test fails.
#   - `set +e / -e` bounded around the test-function dispatch block lets
#     all tests run to completion before the summary.
#
# Note: the sentinel `__DREAM_RESULT__` is emitted by the Python streaming
# endpoint (routers/setup.py), not by this shell script directly. The shell
# just needs to exit with the right code so the endpoint can report it.
# Sentinel-delivery itself is covered by PR-2F's Python tests.
