# Test: community extensions port-binding sweep
# ============================================================================
# Regression guard for PR #964 follow-up: every community extension compose
# file under resources/dev/extensions-library/services/ must bind its host
# ports via ${BIND_ADDRESS:-127.0.0.1} — never a bare "127.0.0.1:" literal.
# A hard-coded 127.0.0.1 defeats the --lan / dashboard opt-in that flips
# BIND_ADDRESS to 0.0.0.0.
#
# Scope: ports: list entries only. healthcheck: blocks reference 127.0.0.1
# as container-internal loopback and are excluded.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test-bind-address-sweep.sh
# ============================================================================
