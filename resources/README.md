# DreamServer Resources

DreamServer is a local-first AI platform — voice agents, tool-calling LLMs, and a full inference stack running on hardware you own. This is everything we built and learned along the way.

**~490 files** · 100% tool-calling success (150 tests) · 20-30 concurrent voice sessions per GPU · 33 service extensions · 32-document agent architecture blueprint

## What's Inside

### [`multi-agent/`](multi-agent/) — How We Ran a Self-Organizing AI Team

**Start here if you're interested in multi-agent systems.** Complete documentation of the OpenClaw Collective — 4 AI agents that self-organized on consumer GPUs, producing 3,464 commits in 8 days with 10 human commits. Covers architecture, six transferable patterns (deterministic supervision, workspace-as-brain, mission governance, session lifecycle, memory stratification, self-healing infrastructure), the governance files loaded into every agent session, operational lessons from 24/7 production, swarm playbooks with reliability math, and design decisions with full rationale. Framework-agnostic — the patterns apply to any multi-agent setup.

### Agent Systems Blueprint — 32 Documents, 14,384 Lines

**A complete, vendor-neutral blueprint for building a production agentic coding tool from scratch.** Extracted as open-source best practices from exhaustive analysis of production agentic systems. Zero proprietary code. Zero vendor-specific terms. Every pattern described in original writing.

> **Start here:** [`AGENT-ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md`](research/agent-systems/AGENT-ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md) — the master map with dependency graphs, error boundaries, and end-to-end walkthroughs.
>
> **For local AI:** [`AGENT-LOCAL-LLM-ADAPTATION.md`](research/agent-systems/AGENT-LOCAL-LLM-ADAPTATION.md) — bridges all cloud patterns to DreamServer's local stack (llama-server, LiteLLM, GPU VRAM budgeting, tool calling tiers).

This content was extracted from three Light Heart Labs repositories:

- **[GLO](https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/GLO)** — Multi-voice agent framework (→ `frameworks/voice-agent/`)
- **[Android Labs](https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/Android-Labs)** — Predecessor project where the AI agent collective produced most of this content (→ `multi-agent/`, `products/`, `research/`, `cookbooks/`, `tools/`, `blog/`)
- **DreamServer development** — Infrastructure and operational tools (→ `docs/`, `legacy/`)
- **Production agentic systems analysis** — Vendor-neutral architecture extraction (→ 32 `AGENT-*.md` documents)

All content was produced by local AI agents running on consumer GPU hardware as part of DreamServer development.
