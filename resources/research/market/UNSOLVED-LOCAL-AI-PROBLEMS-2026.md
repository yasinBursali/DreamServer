## Overview

Small businesses trying to self-host AI face significant friction. These are the real barriers preventing widespread local AI adoption.

---

## 1. Hardware Barriers

**The Problem:** GPUs capable of running useful models are expensive and hard to source.

- **Limited GPU Availability:** RTX 4090s still command premium prices; enterprise cards (A100, H100) are out of reach
- **Resource Constraints:** Smaller businesses lack physical space, power, and cooling for AI infrastructure
- **Scalability Issues:** Can't easily scale up for peak demand or down during quiet periods
- **Mobile/Edge Gap:** Laptops and edge devices can't run production-quality models without severe compromises

**What Would Help:**
- Better model quantization (AWQ, GPTQ) making 32B models fit in 24GB
- Cloud burst options that don't require re-architecting
- Hardware rental/lease programs for SMBs

---

## 2. Software Complexity

**The Problem:** The stack is too complicated for non-experts.

- **Deployment Tools:** Docker, CUDA, vLLM, model formats, API compatibility — too many moving parts
- **Integration Hell:** Connecting AI to existing business systems requires custom development
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Updates, driver compatibility, container orchestration — all require specialized knowledge
- **Documentation Gaps:** Most guides assume Linux expertise that Windows/Mac users don't have

**What Would Help:**
- One-click installers (like Dream Server aims to be)
- Standardized APIs across all inference engines
- Better error messages that tell you what's actually wrong

---

## 3. Maintenance Burden

**The Problem:** Running AI locally is a full-time job.

- **Constant Updates:** Models, drivers, inference engines, and dependencies all update frequently
- **Operational Monitoring:** No easy way to know if your AI is performing well or degrading
- **Training Data Management:** Fine-tuning requires data pipelines that SMBs can't build
- **Breakage:** Updates often break things; rollback is painful

**What Would Help:**
- Automated update systems with rollback
- Built-in monitoring dashboards
- Managed fine-tuning services that work with local deployment

---

## 4. Security Concerns

**The Problem:** Local doesn't automatically mean secure.

- **Data Privacy:** PII in prompts/responses needs protection even locally
- **Model Theft:** Expensive fine-tuned models can be exfiltrated
- **Adversarial Attacks:** Prompt injection, jailbreaks, data poisoning
- **Access Control:** Who can use the AI? What can they ask? Hard to enforce.

**What Would Help:**
- Privacy proxies (like M3 Privacy Shield)
- Built-in audit logging
- Role-based access control for AI endpoints
- Model encryption at rest

---

## 5. Model Limitations

**The Problem:** Local models still can't match cloud APIs for many tasks.

- **Interpretability:** Can't explain why the model said what it said
- **Bias and Fairness:** No easy way to audit or fix model biases
- **Capability Gaps:** Multimodal, long context, complex reasoning still favor cloud
- **Adaptability:** Models can't learn from production use without expensive retraining

**What Would Help:**
- Better small models (Qwen 32B is a step forward)
- Built-in RAG for domain knowledge
- Lightweight fine-tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA)
- Confidence/uncertainty scores in responses

## Implications for DreamServer

These problems map directly to our missions:

| Problem | Mission | Our Response |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Hardware Barriers | M6 | Min hardware research, edge models |
| Software Complexity | M5 | Dream Server one-click install |
| Maintenance Burden | M7 | OpenClaw automation, monitoring |
| Security Concerns | M3 | Privacy Shield |
| Model Limitations | M4, M9 | Deterministic pipelines, OSS advocacy |

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with Windows test** — Which of these come up on a real Windows laptop?
2. **Prioritize** — Focus on problems that block the most users
3. **Build solutions** — Each problem is a potential product/feature
