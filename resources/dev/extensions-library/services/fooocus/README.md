## What It Does

Fooocus provides a simple, beautiful interface for generating AI images. It's designed to be easy to use while still offering powerful features like:

- Text-to-image generation
- Image-to-image generation
- Advanced controlnet integration
- Multiple sampling methods
- High-resolution upscaling

## Configuration

Fooocus uses sensible defaults. No manual configuration needed.

## Usage

1. Enable the extension: `dream enable fooocus`
2. Access the UI at `http://localhost:7865`
3. Start generating images with natural language prompts

## Integration

Fooocus runs as a standalone image generation service. It does not connect to Dream Server's LLM endpoint since it's purely an image generation tool.

## Uninstall

Disable the extension: `dream disable fooocus`

This will remove the container but preserve your generated images in `./data/fooocus/`.
