# Forge / A1111

The original Stable Diffusion web UI (based on Automatic1111). Features extensive model support, extensions, inpainting, outpainting, and professional-grade image generation capabilities.

## Hardware compatibility

This extension ships a pinned image digest. The bundled Torch + CUDA build inside that image is not portable across every NVIDIA generation, so compatibility is constrained by the image rather than DreamServer itself.

- **NVIDIA-only.** The manifest declares `gpu_backends: [nvidia]`, so this extension is filtered out at install time on AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon, and CPU-only systems. Apple Silicon and CPU-only hosts cannot install it.
- **Confirmed broken: NVIDIA RTX 3070 Mobile (compute capability sm_86) under CUDA driver capability 12.4.** The container starts and the host shows it as running, but the Forge process inside crashes with `Your device does not support the current version of Torch/CUDA`. The pinned Torch wheel in the bundled `ghcr.io/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui-forge` image is incompatible with this hardware/driver combination.
- **Untested: all other NVIDIA hardware.** RTX 30-series desktop parts, other sm_86 mobile parts, RTX 40-series (sm_89), Hopper (sm_90), and earlier generations have not been live-tested with this image. We make no prediction about whether they work or fail — treat them as unknown until tested on real hardware.
- **Linux:** the live-confirmed failure above was reproduced on Linux with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. Non-sm_86 Linux hosts are untested.
- **Windows / WSL2:** the same image runs under WSL2 with `nvidia-container-toolkit`. Because the Torch/CUDA mismatch is internal to the image, a WSL2 host on the same RTX 3070 Mobile (sm_86) silicon is **inferred to hit the same crash** — but this has **not** been live-tested. Treat as inferred, not confirmed.
- **macOS:** Apple Silicon and Intel Macs cannot run this extension. The manifest's `gpu_backends: [nvidia]` filter removes it from the install set on macOS.

If you hit the incompatibility on supported-but-unlisted hardware, the upstream project is [lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge); building a compatible image yourself or substituting an alternative Forge image is currently the only path forward, and is outside the scope of this packaged extension.

## Requirements

- **GPU:** NVIDIA (min 8 GB VRAM)
- **Dependencies:** None

## Enable / Disable

```bash
dream enable forge
dream disable forge
```

Your data is preserved when disabling. To re-enable later: `dream enable forge`

## Access

- **URL:** `http://localhost:7861`

## First-Time Setup

1. Enable the service: `dream enable forge`
2. Open `http://localhost:7861`
3. Start generating images with the txt2img tab

First startup may download several GB of model files. Subsequent starts are instant.

### API Usage

```bash
# Generate via txt2img API
curl -X POST http://localhost:7861/sdapi/v1/txt2img \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "a photo of a cat in a garden",
    "steps": 20,
    "width": 512,
    "height": 512
  }'

# Check progress
curl http://localhost:7861/sdapi/v1/progress
```
