# DreamServer Extensions Library

**32 service extensions being tested for DreamServer. 17 are already in production — these are next.**

Each extension is a self-contained directory with a `manifest.yaml` (service metadata), `compose.yaml` (Docker Compose fragment), and optional Dockerfiles, workflows, and documentation. Drop any of these into your DreamServer's `extensions/services/` directory and run `dream enable <service-id>`.

## Workflows

├── bark/          — Voice synthesis pipelines
├── comfyui/       — LLM-to-image generation
├── flowise/       — Chatflow API templates
├── langflow/      — Flow API templates

├── sillytavern/   — Status monitoring
├── text-generation-webui/  — Chat completion, model listing
└── whisper/       — Speech-to-text conversion
```

## Templates

Everything you need to build your own extension:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `service-template.yaml` | Complete manifest with every field documented |
| `compose-template.yaml` | Compose fragment with best practices |
| `compose-gpu-only.yaml` | GPU-only service pattern (no CPU fallback) |
| `compose-gpu-swap.yaml` | CPU base + GPU overlay pattern |
| `dashboard-plugin-template.js` | Dashboard UI plugin scaffold |

## Schema

`schema/service-manifest.v1.json` — JSON Schema for validating manifest files.

```bash
# Validate any manifest:
python3 -c "
import json, yaml
from jsonschema import validate
schema = json.load(open('schema/service-manifest.v1.json'))
manifest = yaml.safe_load(open('services/bark/manifest.yaml'))
validate(manifest, schema)
print('Valid!')
"
```

## How to Use

**Add a service to your DreamServer:**
```bash
# Copy the extension into your DreamServer
cp -r resources/dev/extensions-library/services/bark extensions/services/bark

# Enable and start it
dream enable bark
dream start bark
```

**Build your own extension:**
```bash
# Copy the template
cp -r resources/dev/extensions-library/templates/ my-service/
mv my-service/service-template.yaml my-service/manifest.yaml
mv my-service/compose-template.yaml my-service/compose.yaml

# Edit, then validate
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('my-service/manifest.yaml'))"
```

---

## Status

These extensions are actively tested on DreamServer development builds. Some are battle-tested (Ollama, ChromaDB, Bark), others are newer. All follow the v1 manifest schema and integrate with the DreamServer service registry, dashboard, and CLI.

**17 services have already graduated to production** — these 32 are being prepared for the next wave.
