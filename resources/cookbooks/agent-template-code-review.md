# Agent Template: Code Review Agent

> **Purpose:** Automated pull request and code review with structured, actionable feedback.
> **Use when:** You need consistent code review coverage, want to catch common issues early, or need to scale review capacity across a team.

---

## Agent Overview

The **Code Review Agent** analyzes code changes (PRs, commits, or files) and provides structured feedback on quality, security, style, and maintainability. It acts as a first-pass reviewer, catching common issues before human review.

### Why This Agent?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Inconsistent review coverage | Automated first-pass on every PR |
| Reviewer bottleneck | Instant feedback, 24/7 availability |
| Missed security issues | Pattern-based security scanning |
| Style debates | Consistent, configurable linting |
| Knowledge silos | Architecture rule enforcement |

### Best Suited For

- **Large codebases** with many contributors
- **Security-sensitive** applications
- **Teams** with mixed experience levels
- **Projects** with established style guides
- **Repetitive review patterns** (boilerplate checks)

## Sample Conversation

### Example 1: Pull Request Review

**User:** Review PR #234 in the GLO repo

**Agent:** 
```
Fetching PR #234 from Light-Heart-Labs/GLO...
Analyzing 3 files changed (+127, -43 lines)

## Summary
This PR adds user authentication middleware and updates the login flow. 
Overall quality is good with solid error handling, but there are 2 security 
concerns that need addressing.

## Issues Found

### 🔴 CRITICAL (1)

**File:** `src/auth/middleware.ts` (line 34)
**Issue:** JWT secret loaded from environment without validation
```typescript
const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;  // Could be undefined!
```
**Fix:**
```typescript
const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!secret) {
  throw new Error('JWT_SECRET environment variable is required');
}
```
**Why:** If JWT_SECRET is not set, tokens will be signed with `undefined`, 
which could lead to authentication bypass or signature validation failures.

### 🟠 HIGH (1)

**File:** `src/auth/login.ts` (line 52)
**Issue:** Timing attack vulnerability in password comparison
```typescript
if (user.password === hashedInput) {  // Vulnerable to timing attacks
```
**Fix:**
```typescript
import { timingSafeEqual } from 'crypto';
// ...
if (timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(user.password), Buffer.from(hashedInput))) {
```
**Why:** Direct string comparison short-circuits on first mismatch, allowing 
attackers to guess passwords byte-by-byte by measuring response times.

### 🟡 MEDIUM (1)

**File:** `src/auth/login.ts` (lines 18-25)
**Issue:** No rate limiting on login attempts
**Suggestion:** Consider adding rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
Example using express-rate-limit:
```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5 // limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
});
```

### 🟢 LOW (2)

1. **File:** `src/auth/middleware.ts` (line 12)
   - Function name `checkAuth` could be more descriptive (`authenticateRequest`)

2. **File:** `tests/auth.test.ts` (line 45)
   - Test name "should work" is vague. Consider "should return 401 for invalid token"

## Positive Notes

✅ Good separation of concerns between middleware and login logic
✅ Proper async/await usage with try/catch blocks
✅ Comprehensive test coverage for happy paths
✅ Clear error messages returned to client

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding a `SECURITY.md` file documenting the authentication flow
2. Add integration tests for the full login → protected route flow
3. Set up automated dependency scanning (e.g., Dependabot)

---
**Action Required:** Please address the 🔴 CRITICAL and 🟠 HIGH issues before merging.
```

### Example 2: File Review

**User:** Review the changes I made to `/home/user/project/src/api/handlers.ts`

**Agent:**
```
Reading file /home/user/project/src/api/handlers.ts...

## Summary
File shows good TypeScript practices with proper typing. However, there are 
repetition patterns that could be refactored for better maintainability.

## Issues Found

### 🟡 MEDIUM (2)

**File:** `src/api/handlers.ts` (lines 23-45, 67-89)
**Issue:** Duplicated error handling pattern
Both `getUser` and `updateUser` have identical try/catch blocks:
```typescript
try {
  // ... handler logic
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
}
```
**Fix:** Extract to a wrapper function:
```typescript
const asyncHandler = (fn: RequestHandler): RequestHandler => 
  (req, res, next) => Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);

// Usage
app.get('/user/:id', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // ... just the logic
}));
```

**File:** `src/api/handlers.ts` (line 34)
**Issue:** Magic number used
```typescript
if (users.length > 100) {  // What is 100?
```
**Fix:** 
```typescript
const MAX_USERS_PER_REQUEST = 100;
if (users.length > MAX_USERS_PER_REQUEST) {
```

### 🟢 LOW (1)

**File:** `src/api/handlers.ts` (line 12)
**Issue:** Unused import
```typescript
import { validateUser } from '../utils/validation';  // Never used
```

## Positive Notes

✅ Proper use of async/await throughout
✅ Good TypeScript type annotations
✅ RESTful endpoint naming
✅ Consistent error response format

## LGTM 👍
No critical or high-severity issues found. The medium issues are refactor 
suggestions that could be addressed in a follow-up PR.
```

### Example 3: Quick Security Scan

**User:** Quick security check on this diff

**Agent:**
```
Analyzing provided diff...

## Security Scan Results

### 🔴 CRITICAL (1)

**Issue:** SQL injection vulnerability
```diff
- const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`);
+ const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);
```
**Status:** ❌ NOT FIXED - Still using string concatenation

### 🟠 HIGH (1)

**Issue:** CORS misconfiguration allows any origin
```diff
- app.use(cors({ origin: '*' }));
+ app.use(cors({ origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000' }));
```

## Action Required

🚨 **DO NOT MERGE** until SQL injection is fixed. Use parameterized queries 
for all database access.
```

## Advanced Features

### Incremental Reviews

The agent can review only new changes since the last review:

```yaml
incremental: true
base_commit: "last-reviewed"  # Or specific SHA
```

### Learning Mode

The agent can learn from your team's review patterns:

```yaml
learning:
  enabled: true
  examples: 
    - "reviews/historical/approved/"  # Good examples
    - "reviews/historical/rejected/"  # Bad examples to avoid
```

### Multi-Language Support

Configure language-specific reviewers:

```yaml
languages:
  typescript:
    linter: eslint
    config: .eslintrc.json
  python:
    linter: ruff
    config: pyproject.toml
  rust:
    linter: clippy
    config: .clippy.toml
```

---

## Best Practices

### Do ✅

- Configure the agent with your project's style guide
- Use it for first-pass review, not final approval
- Train it on your team's historical reviews
- Set up different rule sets for different file types
- Combine with traditional linters (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

### Don't ❌

- Rely on it exclusively for security-critical code
- Use it to replace junior developer mentorship
- Ignore its suggestions without consideration
- Configure it to be overly nitpicky (causes alert fatigue)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent is too verbose
```yaml
verbosity: concise  # Options: minimal, concise, detailed, verbose
```

### Missing context
Ensure your agent loads relevant context files:
```yaml
context:
  - README.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - docs/architecture.md
```

### False positives
Add ignore patterns:
```yaml
ignore:
  - "**/*.test.ts"  # Test files
  - "**/generated/**"  # Auto-generated code
  - "legacy/**"  # Known tech debt
```

---

## Metrics & Improvement

Track the agent's effectiveness:

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
  track:
    - issues_found_per_review
    - false_positive_rate
    - time_saved_estimate
    - suggestion_acceptance_rate
```
