## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Technical Documentation

**User:** Write API documentation for a user authentication endpoint.

**Agent:** I'll create comprehensive API documentation following REST conventions.

**Understanding:**
- **Audience:** Backend developers integrating with your API
- **Purpose:** Clear integration instructions
- **Tone:** Technical, precise
- **Format:** Standard API doc structure

**Draft:**

```markdown
## Authentication

### POST /api/v1/auth/login

Authenticate a user and receive an access token.

#### Request

**Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secure_password"
}
```

**Field Reference:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| email | string | Yes | User's registered email |
| password | string | Yes | User's password |

#### Response

**Success (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "user": {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    },
    "expires_at": "2026-02-12T16:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**

| Status | Code | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 400 | INVALID_REQUEST | Malformed JSON or missing fields |
| 401 | INVALID_CREDENTIALS | Email or password incorrect |
| 429 | RATE_LIMITED | Too many attempts, try again later |

**Error Example (401):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
    "message": "Email or password is incorrect"
  }
}
```

#### Usage Example

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.example.com/v1/auth/login',
    json={
        'email': 'user@example.com',
        'password': 'secure_password'
    }
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    token = response.json()['data']['token']
    # Store token for subsequent requests
else:
    error = response.json()['error']['message']
    print(f"Login failed: {error}")
```

#### Security Notes

- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Implement token refresh before expiration
- Store tokens securely (never in localStorage)
- Use HTTPS only in production
```

### Example 2: Content Editing

**User:** Edit this paragraph to be more concise and professional.

> We are very excited to announce that we have been working really hard on this new feature and we think that it is going to be very helpful for all of our users who have been asking for this capability for a long time now.

**Agent:** 

**Issues identified:**
- "Very excited" — weak emotional qualifier
- "really hard" — vague intensifier
- "we think" — hedging language
- "very helpful" — weak adjective
- "for a long time now" — wordy time reference

**Revised:**

> We're launching a highly requested feature that streamlines user workflows.

**Changes:**
- Cut from 42 to 11 words (74% reduction)
- Removed hedging ("we think")
- Specific benefit ("streamlines workflows")
- Maintained enthusiasm through "highly requested"

### Example 3: Tutorial Writing

**User:** Write a quick start guide for Docker beginners.

**Agent:** I'll create a beginner-friendly Docker quick start.

```markdown
# Docker Quick Start

Get your first container running in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Basic command line familiarity

## Your First Container

### 1. Run a Simple Container

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

**What happened:**
1. Docker downloaded the `hello-world` image
2. Created a new container from that image
3. Ran the container (it printed a message)
4. The container exited

### 2. Run an Interactive Container

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

**Flags explained:**
- `-i` — Interactive mode (keep STDIN open)
- `-t` — Allocate a pseudo-TTY (terminal)

You're now inside an Ubuntu container. Try some commands:

```bash
ls
cat /etc/os-release
exit
```

### 3. Run a Web Server

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

**Flags explained:**
- `-d` — Detached mode (run in background)
- `-p 8080:80` — Map host port 8080 to container port 80

Visit `http://localhost:8080` — you should see the nginx welcome page.

### 4. Clean Up

```bash
# Stop the nginx container
docker ps                    # List running containers
docker stop <container_id>   # Stop the container
docker rm <container_id>     # Remove it

# Or stop and remove in one command
docker stop <container_id> && docker rm <container_id>
```

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Image** | Read-only template with application + dependencies |
| **Container** | Running instance of an image |
| **Registry** | Storage for images (Docker Hub is the default) |
| **Dockerfile** | Script to build custom images |

## Next Steps

- [Build a custom image with Dockerfile](next-dockerfile.md)
- [Use Docker Compose for multi-container apps](next-compose.md)
- [Understand container networking](next-networking.md)

## Common Commands

```bash
docker ps              # List running containers
docker images          # List downloaded images
docker logs <id>       # View container logs
docker exec -it <id> bash  # Enter running container
docker system prune    # Clean up unused resources
```
```

## Best Practices for Local Models

### Be Specific About Format

```markdown
<!-- Good: Clear format specification -->
Write a 3-paragraph blog post in markdown with:
- Paragraph 1: Hook (1-2 sentences)
- Paragraph 2: Main content (3-4 sentences)
- Paragraph 3: Call to action (1-2 sentences)

<!-- Avoid: Vague request -->
Write a blog post
```

### Provide Examples

Show the style you want:

```markdown
Tone example: "Docker makes deployment simple. Here's how..."
(NOT: "Docker is a containerization platform that enables...")
```

### Iterate on Feedback

```markdown
Draft 1: [content]
User: "Make it more casual"
Draft 2: [revised with contractions, conversational tone]
```

### Handle Rejection Gracefully

If the user doesn't like the output:
- Ask specific questions about what's wrong
- Offer alternatives
- Don't defend the draft, improve it

## Integration Examples

### Documentation Generator

```bash
# Auto-generate README from code
openclaw agent run writing-specialist \
  --task "generate README for this project"
```

### Style Checker

```bash
# Check docs against style guide
openclaw agent run writing-specialist \
  --task "review docs/ for style compliance"
```

### Content Pipeline

```yaml
# Content calendar automation
cron:
  - schedule: "0 9 * * 1"
    task: writing-specialist
    prompt: "draft weekly blog post from research notes"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Output too formal | Request "casual tone, use contractions" |
| Output too long | Specify word/paragraph count |
| Wrong style | Provide example of desired style |
| Missing sections | Request specific structure |
| Too generic | Ask for specific examples |
